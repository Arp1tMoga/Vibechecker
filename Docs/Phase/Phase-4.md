# Phase 4: Testing & Optimization

See [architecture.md] for all shared definitions, standards, and specifications. All steps below are fully detailed and must be followed exactly. No ambiguity or deferred decisions permitted.

---

## Step 1: Unit & Integration Testing

### 1.1. Endpoint Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for all MCP server endpoints (`/upload_codebase`, `/trigger_review`, `/get_results`).
- Test valid and invalid payloads, file size limits, error codes, and response schemas as specified in architecture.md.
- Use automated test frameworks (Pytest for Python, Jest for Node CLI, etc.).
- Deliverable: `endpoint_tests.py` (Python) or `endpoint_tests.js` (Node), test coverage report, and `test_docs.md` documenting all test cases and results.

### 1.2. Agent Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for all agents (Documentation, Debt, Improvement, Critical Issue).
- Validate outputs against pydantic models and templates.
- Test edge cases (missing fields, invalid types, out-of-range values, empty codebase, large codebase).
- Deliverable: `agent_tests.py`, test coverage report, and `test_docs.md`.

### 1.3. Workflow Testing
- Test DSPy/LangChain workflows for each agent.
- Validate prompt engineering, memory usage, output formats, and error handling.
- Deliverable: `workflow_tests.py`, workflow coverage report, and `test_docs.md`.

### 1.4. Validation Testing
- Test output validation logic for all agent outputs.
- Simulate validation errors and document handling strategies.
- Deliverable: `validation_tests.py`, validation coverage report, and `test_docs.md`.

## Step 2: Performance Optimization

### 2.1. Benchmarking
- Benchmark feedback latency and scalability for all endpoints and agent workflows.
- Use codebases of varying sizes (small, medium, large up to 100k lines).
- Document results, bottlenecks, and optimization strategies.
- Deliverable: `benchmark_report.md` and raw benchmark data files.

### 2.2. Optimization
- Optimize agent workflows, server throughput, and resource usage based on benchmark results.
- Refactor code for efficiency (parallelization, caching, memory management).
- Document all optimizations and their impact.
- Deliverable: `optimization_report.md` and updated code files.

## Step 3: Security & Reliability Review

### 3.1. Security Testing
- Audit codebase upload and agent sandboxing for vulnerabilities.
- Test input validation, file size limits, error handling, and compliance with architecture.md.
- Deliverable: `security_audit.md`, vulnerability report, and remediation steps.

### 3.2. Reliability Testing
- Simulate server failures, agent crashes, and network issues.
- Test error recovery, retry logic, and logging.
- Deliverable: `reliability_report.md`, failure scenarios, and recovery documentation.
