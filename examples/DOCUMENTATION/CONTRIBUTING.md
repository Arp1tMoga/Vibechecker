## Development Setup

This project is written in Python. To get started with development:

1.  **Ensure Python is installed:** We recommend Python 3.x.
2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies** (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # If a requirements.txt file exists
    ```
4.  You can now run the Python scripts directly.

## Coding Style

Please adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style. Using a linter like `flake8` or a formatter like `black` is highly recommended to ensure consistency.
