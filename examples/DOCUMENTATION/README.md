# Python Examples Collection

This repository contains a collection of small, independent Python scripts designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and basic functionalities.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── example1.py
├── example2.py
└── example3.py
```

## Installation

No specific installation steps are required beyond having a Python interpreter (version 3.x recommended) installed on your system.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently from your terminal using the Python interpreter.

To run a specific example:

```bash
python example1.py
python example2.py
python example3.py
```

Note: Some scripts might not produce visible output unless modified to print results or called from a main execution block.

## File Descriptions

### `example1.py`

A simple script demonstrating basic Python function definition (`greet`) and usage. It showcases how functions can accept various data types as arguments (integers, `None`, lists) and includes a loop that modifies a variable within the function's scope.

### `example2.py`

This file defines a `Calc` class that encapsulates fundamental arithmetic operations. It provides methods for addition (`add`), subtraction (`sub`), multiplication (`mul`), and division (`div`), illustrating basic object-oriented programming concepts.

### `example3.py`

A script designed to process a list of employee records. It calculates a total value (likely earnings or a similar metric) for each employee based on their hours worked. The script includes conditional logic to apply a different rate for hours exceeding 40, simulating overtime pay calculation.
