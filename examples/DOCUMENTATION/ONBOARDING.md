# Project Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the project! This document provides a quick overview to help you get started with understanding the codebase.

## 1. Project Overview

This project consists of a small collection of Python scripts demonstrating various functionalities, including basic utility functions, arithmetic calculations, and simple data processing logic. It serves as a foundational set of examples or a small utility suite.

## 2. Codebase Structure

The project is organized into a few Python files, each serving a distinct purpose:

```
.
├── example1.py
├── example2.py
└── example3.py
```

## 3. Key Modules and Their Functionality

### `example1.py`

*   **Purpose**: This file appears to contain a `greet` function that demonstrates string manipulation and printing. The `main` function showcases calls to `greet` with different data types (integer, None, list), which might be for testing type handling or demonstrating flexible input. 
*   **Key Functions**: 
    *   `greet(name)`: Prints a greeting multiple times, modifying the `name` variable in a loop.
    *   `main()`: Entry point for demonstrating `greet` with various inputs.
*   **Note**: There's a suspicious comment ` #password : 234567` within the `main` function. This should be reviewed and removed if it contains sensitive information or is not relevant.

### `example2.py`

*   **Purpose**: This file defines a `Calc` class, providing fundamental arithmetic operations. It acts as a utility module for basic mathematical computations.
*   **Key Components**: 
    *   `class Calc`: A class encapsulating arithmetic methods.
    *   `add(self, a, b)`: Adds two numbers.
    *   `sub(self, a, b)`: Subtracts two numbers.
    *   `mul(self, a, b)`: Multiplies two numbers.
    *   `div(self, a, b)`: Divides two numbers.

### `example3.py`

*   **Purpose**: This script processes a list of employee data, likely to calculate total earnings or similar metrics based on hours and rates. It demonstrates basic list iteration and conditional logic for data processing.
*   **Key Logic**: 
    *   Initializes an `employees` list with nested lists (e.g., `[name, hours, rate]`).
    *   Iterates through the `employees` list.
    *   Applies conditional logic (e.g., `if emp[1] > 40`) to calculate a `total`, suggesting overtime calculation or similar payroll logic.

## 4. Getting Started

To run these scripts, you will need Python installed on your system. 

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal.

## 5. Running the Code

You can run individual scripts directly using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python example1.py
python example2.py # Note: This file defines a class, you'd need to instantiate and call methods to see output.
python example3.py
```

## 6. Next Steps

*   Familiarize yourself with the code in each file.
*   If you plan to contribute, please refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if available) for guidelines.
*   For any questions, reach out to the project maintainers.
