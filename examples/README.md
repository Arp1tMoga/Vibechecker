# Examples

This directory contains examples and sample codebases for the Multi-Agent MCP Server.

## Directory Structure

- `sample_codebases/` - Sample Python codebases used for testing and demonstration
- `usage_examples/` - Code examples showing how to use the MCP server
- `api_examples/` - Examples of API usage and integration

## Sample Codebases

The sample codebases in `sample_codebases/` are intentionally designed with various code quality issues to demonstrate the capabilities of different agents:

- **example1.py** - Contains type errors, code smells, and security issues
- **example2.py** - Additional examples for testing different agent capabilities
- **example3.py** - More complex scenarios for comprehensive analysis

## Usage Examples

See the `usage_examples/` directory for practical examples of how to integrate and use the Multi-Agent MCP Server in your projects.
