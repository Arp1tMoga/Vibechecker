# Phase 5: Documentation & Release

See [architecture.md] for all shared definitions, standards, and specifications. All steps below are fully detailed and must be followed exactly. No ambiguity or deferred decisions permitted.

---

## Step 1: Internal Documentation

### 1.1. Architecture Documentation
- Document the full system architecture, including:
  - Agent roles and orchestration logic
  - Endpoint specifications and payload schemas
  - DSPy/LangChain workflow diagrams
  - Validation schemas and error handling strategies
- Use markdown and diagrams (SVG/PNG) as specified in architecture.md.
- Deliverable: `architecture_docs.md` and diagrams in `/docs/architecture/`

### 1.2. Code Documentation
- Write docstrings and inline comments for all modules, classes, and functions.
- Ensure all public APIs, agent interfaces, and workflows are documented.
- Use automated tools (Sphinx for Python, JSDoc for Node) to generate API docs.
- Deliverable: `api_docs/` directory with generated documentation and `code_docs.md` summary.

---

## Step 2: User Documentation

### 2.1. Setup & Usage Guides
- Write step-by-step guides for:
  - Installing the MCP server via npx
  - Uploading a codebase
  - Triggering a review
  - Retrieving results
- Include example commands, payloads, expected outputs, and troubleshooting tips.
- Deliverable: `README.md` (usage guide), `setup_guide.md`, and `usage_examples.md`

### 2.2. Best Practices & Reference
- Document best practices for:
  - Preparing codebases for review
  - Interpreting agent outputs
  - Integrating MCP server into CI/CD workflows (if applicable)
- Include links to reference documentation samples in `/docs/reference/`
- Deliverable: `best_practices.md` and `reference_links.md`

---

## Step 3: Release Preparation

### 3.1. Versioning & Changelog
- Ensure semantic versioning (semver) is used for all releases.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all new features, bug fixes, and optimizations.
- Deliverable: `CHANGELOG.md` (version history)

### 3.2. License & Compliance
- Include a clear license file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) as specified in architecture.md.
- Document any third-party dependencies and their licenses.
- Deliverable: `LICENSE` and `dependency_licenses.md`

### 3.3. Final Release Checklist
- Verify all deliverables from previous phases are complete and documented.
- Run all tests and ensure 100% pass rate.
- Validate all documentation for clarity, completeness, and accuracy.
- Deliverable: `release_checklist.md` with verification steps and sign-off.
