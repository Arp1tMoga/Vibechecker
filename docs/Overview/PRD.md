# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Summary

**Product Name:**  
Multi-Agent Code Review MCP Server

**Purpose:**  
The Multi-Agent Code Review MCP Server is a Python-only backend protocol server designed to automate codebase analysis and documentation for modern development teams. Leveraging a multi-agent architecture, the system reads entire codebases and generates professional-grade documentation, highlights technical debt, scopes improvements, and flags critical issues. The server uses FastMCP for robust agent orchestration, DSPy and LangChain for advanced prompt engineering, and pydantic for output validation. All interactions are via MCP protocol endpoints—there is no user interface.

**Target Audience:**  
- Developers and teams integrating MCP protocol into their workflows
- Backend engineers seeking automated, actionable code review and documentation
- Organizations aiming to improve code quality, maintainability, and onboarding speed via protocol-based automation

**Value Proposition:**  
- **Automated Professional Documentation:** Instantly generate all standard documentation files found in large company projects (README, API docs, architecture, onboarding, compliance, etc.)
- **Actionable Code Review:** Receive clear, validated feedback on technical debt, improvement opportunities, and critical issues—via protocol endpoints
- **Extensible & Secure:** Built on open standards (MCP), easily integrates new review agents, and ensures secure handling of codebases

---

## 2. Objectives & Success Criteria

**Objectives:**
- Automate the generation of professional documentation for any codebase
- Identify and highlight technical debt, improvement opportunities, and critical issues
- Provide actionable, validated feedback to developers via MCP endpoints
- Support intent-driven workflows for protocol-based automation

**Success Criteria:**
- Documentation output matches standards from large professional projects
- >90% accuracy in flagging technical debt and critical issues (benchmarked against expert review)
- Feedback delivered in <5 minutes for codebases up to 100k lines
- Positive feedback from developers integrating with MCP (measured via surveys or NPS)

## 3. User Stories / Use Cases

- **As a backend engineer**, I want to upload my codebase via MCP and receive professional documentation and actionable feedback, so I can improve code quality and onboarding.
- **As a team lead**, I want to quickly assess technical debt and critical issues in legacy projects, so I can prioritize refactoring and improvements.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Large, monolithic codebases
  - Incomplete or legacy projects
  - Projects with minimal existing documentation

## 4. Core Features & Requirements

### MCP Server
- Built with FastMCP (Python-only)
- Secure protocol endpoints for codebase upload, review initiation, and output retrieval

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- Master agent orchestrates specialized agents:
  - Documentation Agent: Generates all standard professional documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, API docs, architecture, onboarding, operations, security, compliance, changelog, testing, dependencies, licenses, etc.)
  - Debt Agent: Highlights technical debt
  - Improvement Agent: Flags scope for improvements
  - Critical Issue Agent: Flags urgent problems
- Agents use DSPy and LangChain for prompt engineering and workflow composition

### Documentation Generation
- Outputs match standards from large professional projects, not limited to Python
- Supports all documentation types found in enterprise environments

### Issue Highlighting
- Agents flag technical debt, improvement scope, and critical issues (not auto-fixing)
- Definitions based on best practices and research

### Output Validation
- All outputs validated and serialized via pydantic models
- Structured, reliable feedback

## 5. Technical Requirements

- **Frameworks:** FastMCP, DSPy, LangChain, Pydantic
- **Python Version:** 3.10+
- **Scalability:** Efficient handling of large codebases (up to 100k lines)
- **Extensibility:** Modular agent design for easy addition of new review tasks
- **Security:** Secure codebase upload, sandboxed agent execution

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Feedback delivered in <5 minutes for large codebases
- **Reliability:** Validated outputs, robust error handling
- **Protocol Compliance:** Adheres to MCP standards for endpoint design and payload formats

---

## 7. Out-of-Scope

- No auto-fixing of code issues
- No support for non-codebase uploads (for MVP)
- No direct integration with external CI/CD or deployment tools
- No user interface (CLI, web, or GUI)

---

## 8. Open Questions & Risks

- How to define “professional-grade” documentation standards across languages?
- How to benchmark technical debt and critical issue detection?
- LLM cost and latency for large codebases?
- Security/privacy for uploaded codebases?
