# Implementation Roadmap: Multi-Agent Code Review MCP Server

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Research

1. **Deep Dive into FastMCP**
   - Study FastMCP documentation and example servers
   - Prototype a minimal MCP server with basic protocol endpoints
2. **Research Professional Documentation Standards**
   - Analyze documentation from top open-source and enterprise projects (across languages: Python, Java, JS, Go, etc.)
   - Define templates and quality benchmarks for all standard documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, API docs, architecture, onboarding, operations, security, compliance, changelog, testing, dependencies, licenses, etc.)
3. **Define Technical Debt & Critical Issue Criteria**
   - Review academic and industry sources
   - Create checklists for agents to use

---

## Phase 2: Architecture & Schemas

1. **Design Multi-Agent Architecture**
   - Specify master agent and specialized agent roles
   - Define agent communication and orchestration logic
2. **Define Pydantic Output Schemas**
   - Create models for documentation, debt, improvement, and issue outputs
   - Validate with sample data
3. **Plan DSPy & LangChain Integration**
   - Map agent workflows to DSPy/LangChain chains
   - Design prompt templates and optimization strategies

---

## Phase 3: Core Development

1. **Build MCP Server with FastMCP**
   - Implement secure protocol endpoints for codebase upload and output retrieval
   - Integrate agent orchestration logic
2. **Implement Specialized Agents**
   - Documentation Agent: Generates all standard professional documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, API docs, architecture, onboarding, operations, security, compliance, changelog, testing, dependencies, licenses, etc.)
   - Debt Agent: Highlights technical debt
   - Improvement Agent: Flags scope for improvements
   - Critical Issue Agent: Flags urgent problems
3. **Integrate DSPy & LangChain**
   - Connect agents to DSPy/LangChain workflows
   - Test prompt engineering and self-improvement features
4. **Implement Output Validation**
   - Serialize and validate all agent outputs via pydantic
   - Ensure structured, reliable feedback

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Optimization

1. **Unit & Integration Testing**
   - Test all protocol endpoints and agent outputs
   - Validate against large, real-world codebases
2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Benchmark feedback latency and scalability
   - Optimize agent workflows and server throughput
3. **Security & Reliability Review**
   - Audit codebase upload and agent sandboxing
   - Implement robust error handling

---

## Phase 5: Documentation & Launch

1. **Internal Documentation**
   - Document architecture, agent logic, and protocol endpoint usage
2. **Protocol/API Documentation**
   - Write guides for MCP endpoint specification, payload formats, and integration best practices
3. **Beta Launch & Feedback**
   - Release MVP to target users (developers integrating with MCP)
   - Collect feedback and iterate

---

## Phase 6: Post-Launch Improvements

1. **Expand Agent Capabilities**
   - Add new review agents (e.g., style, security, test coverage)
2. **Support for Non-Python Codebases** (optional)
   - Research and prototype multi-language support
3. **Integrate with CI/CD & External Tools** (optional)
   - Explore integrations for automated review workflows

---

## Milestones & Timeline (Suggested)
- **Weeks 1-2:** Foundation & Research
- **Weeks 3-4:** Architecture & Schemas
- **Weeks 5-8:** Core Development
- **Weeks 9-10:** Testing & Optimization
- **Weeks 11-12:** Documentation & Launch
- **Post-Launch:** Continuous improvement
