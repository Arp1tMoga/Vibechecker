# PyTorch API Documentation Summary

## Overview
PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework focused on flexibility and speed. Its API is organized around tensor operations, neural network modules, and hardware acceleration (CPU/GPU). The documentation covers stable, beta, and prototype features, with clear release status indicators.

## Main API Components
- **torch**: Core tensor library, mathematical operations, random number generation, serialization, and more.
- **torch.nn**: Neural network layers, loss functions, activation functions, and model building blocks.
- **torch.nn.functional**: Functional interface for layers and operations.
- **torch.Tensor**: The main data structure for computation, supporting a wide range of operations and attributes.
- **torch.autograd**: Automatic differentiation for gradient computation.
- **torch.optim**: Optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, etc.).
- **torch.utils.data**: Data loading, batching, and dataset utilities.
- **torch.cuda**: GPU acceleration and memory management.
- **torch.jit**: Just-in-time compilation for performance and deployment.
- **torch.distributed**: Distributed training and parallelism.
- **torch.fft, torch.linalg, torch.special**: Advanced mathematical operations.
- **torchvision, torchaudio, torchtext**: Domain-specific libraries for images, audio, and text.

## Usage Patterns
- **Tensor Operations**: Creation, manipulation, and computation with tensors.
- **Model Definition**: Using `torch.nn.Module` to define neural networks.
- **Training Loop**: Forward pass, loss computation, backward pass (autograd), optimizer step.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Seamless switching between CPU and GPU.
- **Extensibility**: Custom layers, operators, and integration with other libraries.
