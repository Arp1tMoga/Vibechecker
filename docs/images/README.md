# Multi-Agent MCP Server Icon

The icon for this project can be found at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arpit-Moga/Vibechecker/main/docs/images/icon.png

## Icon Requirements

For Smithery and MCP compatibility, the icon should be:
- Size: 512x512 pixels minimum
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Design: Simple, recognizable, related to code analysis/review
- Background: Transparent or solid color

## Design Elements

Suggested design elements for the icon:
- Gears or cogs (representing multi-agent system)
- Code symbols (< >, brackets, etc.)
- Magnifying glass (representing analysis)
- Shield (representing security analysis)
- Document/file icon (representing documentation)

The current placeholder icon should be replaced with a professional design that represents the multi-agent code analysis concept.
