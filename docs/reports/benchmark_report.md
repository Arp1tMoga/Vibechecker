# MCP Server Benchmark Report

## Methodology
- Benchmarked all MCP endpoints (`/upload_codebase`, `/trigger_review`, `/get_results`) and agent workflows (Documentation, Debt, Improvement, Critical Issue).
- Used codebases of varying sizes: small (1k lines), medium (10k lines), large (100k lines).
- Measured feedback latency, throughput, and resource usage.
- Tools: Python `time`, `memory_profiler`, and custom scripts.

## Results Summary
- [Placeholder for latency, throughput, and resource usage data]
- [Attach raw benchmark data files]

## Bottlenecks Identified
- [Placeholder for bottleneck analysis]

## Optimization Strategies
- [Placeholder for recommended optimizations]

## Next Steps
- Implement optimizations and re-benchmark.
